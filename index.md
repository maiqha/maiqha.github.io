My goal is to become an expert in data analytics and provide actionable insights to leaders and companies in various fields, in hope that my work can somehow improve everyone's life. I have always been curious and persistent from a young age, qualities that prove to be helpful in the last fews years of my journey with statistics and data analysis. Working in different fields such as manufacturing, education, healthcare, hospitality & services provided me the fortune of experiences, which fosters creative problem solving and open-mindedness. Currently, I am working on multiple self-directed data analysis projects on GitHub to hone my skills in R and Python. Check them out below or on my [GitHub profile] (https://github.com/maiqha).

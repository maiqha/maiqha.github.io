I aspire to become a data analyst in business, healthcare, or education. Having worked in different fields in the past, I've thrived on creative problem-solving and systematic optimization/automation and thus strive to bring these qualities to any place at which I work. I'm keeping myself busy with some data analysis projects on GitHub using R and Python. Check them out below.

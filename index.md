My name is Mai Ha and I have 2 years of work experience in the healthcare industry.

Most recently, I was a program coordinator with SandBay Primary and Urgent Care. While I was there, I created and maintained a data management system on Google Sheets for a major patient panel with an estimated worth of $1M and fostered organizational change through redesigning the task distribution system, facilitating regular business analysis meetings, and building real-time dashboards and progress reports.

My areas of strength include 
(1) a deep understanding of best statistical practices (avoiding biases, hypothesis or A/B testing, sampling, modeling, and reporting methods) while earning my bachelor’s degree in applied statistics;
(2) technical skills for data analysis (query, clean, analyze and share results from data) through online learning and completing data analysis and research projects; and
(3) project management (gathering requirements, planning, managing tasks, and communicating with stakeholders and team members) through self-learning and practicing at work.

Currently, I’m seeking a position as a data analyst in the a company where I’m responsible for 
1. Analyzing large amount of data
2. Generating useful reports and insights
3. Helping the company make data-driven decisions

## Projects

### [Cervical cancer predictive factors](http://maiqha.github.io/cervical-cancer-factors-with-R/)
My most extensive research project using linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and logistic regression analysis. I applied AIC (Stepwise-function) and utilized miscalculation rate for model selection. I used R Markdown to create the final report in PDF and a presentation in HTML.

### [Limited resources teaching R programming at UHD](http://maiqha.github.io/limited-resources-teaching-r-programming-at-uhd/)
I designed a survey and compiled interview questions to determine problems students faced while learning the programming language R at the university. The survey also gathered students suggestions on possible improvements.

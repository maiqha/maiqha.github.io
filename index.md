My goal is to help businesses optimize outcomes, automate processes, and make data-driven decisions. My educational background combined with work experience building systems, making dashboards, and managing projects, made me a versatile generalist with a knack for drawing insights and giving recommendations. I'm now looking for work opportunity to specialize as a data analyst.

## Projects

### [Cervical cancer predictive factors](http://maiqha.github.io/cervical-cancer-factors-with-R/)
My most extensive research project using linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminate analysis, and logistic regression analysis. I also applied AIC (Stepwise-function) and utilized miscalculation rate for model selection.

### [Limited resources teaching R programming at UHD](http://maiqha.github.io/limited-resources-teaching-r-programming-at-uhd/)
I designed a survey to determine problems students faced while learning the programming language R. The survey also gathered students suggestions on possible improvements.

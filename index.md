Welcome to my portfolio!


My professional goal is to help organizations optimize outcomes, automate processes, and make data-driven decisions. My education background combined with work experience building systems, making dashboards, and managing projects, made me a versatile generalist with a knack for drawing business insights and providing recommendations. I'm now looking to specialize in a data analyst role as I'm earning my Google Data Analytics certificate.

## Projects

### [Cervical cancer predictive factors](http://maiqha.github.io/cervical-cancer-factors-with-R/)
My most extensive research project using linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and logistic regression analysis. I applied AIC (Stepwise-function) and utilized miscalculation rate for model selection. I used R Markdown to create the final report in PDF and a presentation in HTML.

### [Limited resources teaching R programming at UHD](http://maiqha.github.io/limited-resources-teaching-r-programming-at-uhd/)
I designed a survey and compiled interview questions to determine problems students faced while learning the programming language R at the university. The survey also gathered students suggestions on possible improvements.

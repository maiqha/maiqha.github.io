I aspire to become a software engineer who utilizes programming to solve business problems. Having worked in different fields in the past, I developed a better practice of teamwork, finding creative solutions, and optimization/automation in the business setting. I'm keeping myself busy with learning and applying data analytics in my current job and working on projects on GitHub.

I aspire to become a data analyst in the fields of business or healthcare, in hope that my work can provide a service/product that improves everyone's life. Having worked in different fields such as manufacturing, education, healthcare, hospitality & services, I realized how useful creative problem solving and open-mindedness can be and strive to bring these qualities to any place I work. There is much to be done with the amount of existing data, and I cannot wait to immerse myself in whatever data you might have and develop a more effective/efficient solution for your company's problem. Currently, I am working on multiple data analysis projects on GitHub using R and Python. Check them out below, as well as on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/maiqha).

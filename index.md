My goal is to help businesses optimize outcomes, automate processes, and make data-driven decisions. My educational background combined with work experience building systems, making dashboards, and managing projects, made me a versatile generalist with a knack for drawing insights and giving recommendations. I'm now looking for work opportunity to specialize as a data analyst.
